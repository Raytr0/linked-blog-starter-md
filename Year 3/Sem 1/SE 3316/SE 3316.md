Week 1:
Hypertext
Markup Languages
Origins of WWW
HTML
### URL
Made up of 3 parts:
	scheme(http), server(example.com), and path(/ex/one/)
### URI
Uniform Resource Identifier
	scheme:scheme-specfic-part
	• “/” for separating hierarchical structure 
	• “?” for separating a query from a resource that can respond to a query 
	• “#” for separating URI from “fragment identifier”
### URN (Not super important)
Pointer to a resource without referring to a particular location. E.g. urn isbn:0-471-94128-X
Not currently widely used
### IDN Homograph Attacks
Using non US-ASCII characters to make an identical website link compared to a legitimate website
### Data Flow Models in WWW

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Html attributes introduced
CSS introduced
### Javascript
Issues:
	Browsers interpret differently
	JQuery has risen as a "quasi standard"
	Lack of features
	Competition:
		Dart from Google
		Typescript from Microsoft
		Coffeescript from Ruby community
### HTML Validity
Syntax errors and such
check with validator.w3.org
### Bytes vs Characters
HTML files are represented as text files
text files are physically sequences of bytes, thus several mappings exist
	ASCII
	EBCDIC
	Unicode
Unicode aims to cover all past and present written characters
### Unicode approach
Uses 32 bit namespace
	Theoretical size of ~4 Billion
	only 1,114,112 are allowed
	May 2020 has 143,859 characters, Sept 12 2023 has 149,814 characters
	covers 161 modern historic scripts
Unicode process assigns a unique number to each character
	Called "code point": U+xxxx in hexadecimal notation
Encoding/Decoding
	Convention for mapping “code points” to a serial bit stream (“code units”) and vice versa
	UTF-8 (8-bit code units), UTF-16 (16 bits)
