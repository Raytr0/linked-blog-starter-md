# Unit 1
### Software Process Flow
Communication -> Planning -> Modeling -> Construction -> Deployment
Multiple different process flows exist in different orders (Slide 8-10)
### Software Development Life Cycle

### Software Process Models (Slides 13-16)
Waterfall model:
	Strengths: 
		Simple, easy to manage
	Weaknesses:
		Inflexible
Prototyping Process model:
	Strengths:
		Helps clarify requirements early
	Weaknesses:
		Risk of building a weak system if prototype is too focused on early-stage needs
Spiral Process model:
	Evolutionary Releases
	Strengths:
		Flexible, suitable for large and complex projects
	Weaknesses:
		Can be costly and time consuming due to multiple iterations 
### Agile Software Development
Core focus: Responding to change and continuous improvement
Defined by the Agile Manifesto in 2001
***Key Principles (Agile Manifesto):***  
	- Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation  
	- Responding to Change over following a plan  
	- Working Software over comprehensive documentation  
	- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
Methodologies:
	Scrum: 
		Framework for managing and completing complex projects through sprints (time-boxed iterations)
		Key roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Dev team
	XP Framework:
		Focuses on engineering practices to improve software quality
	Lean:
		Min Maxing for continuous improvement
	Kanban:
		Visual management approach
	DevOps:
		Integrates development and operations teams to automate and  
		streamline the entire software lifecycle, from development to  
		deployment and operations.  
		â€¢ Focuses on collaboration, continuous integration, and  
		continuous delivery (CI/CD) to ensure faster, more reliable  
		software releases.  
### Traditional vs Modern
Flexibility:
	Traditional:
		Rigid, predetermined phases, limited adaptability
		Changes often lead to increased costs and delays
	Modern (Agile):
		Highly Flexible
		Adaptation is built in to the process
Efficiency:
	Traditional:
		Efficient when requirements are stable
	Modern:
		Efficient even when changes are introduced
		Focused on frequent delivery and continuous improvement
Collaboration:
	Traditional:
		Limited, Customer is usually only communicated in the beginning of the project
	Modern:
		High, stakeholders frequently involved throughout project
		team communication crucial
### Factors influence software methodology selection 
1.\ Project Requirements Stability
	Stable:
		Traditional methods are useful when requirements are unlikely to change
	Evolving:
		Scrum or Kanban are better for evolving projects
2.\ Project Type and Complexity
	Large, Complex Projects:
		Spiral model or incremental model 
	Small, Medium Projects:
		Agile Methodology works well
3.\ Risk Management Needs
	High Risk Projects:
		Spiral, risk assessments at every cycle
	Moderate Risk Projects:
		Agile, but does not have formal risk management
4.\ Customer Involvement:
	Limited Customer Interaction:
		Traditional, Waterfall or V-Model
	Frequent Customer Feedback:
		Agile, project lifecycle needs customer feedback
5.\ Team Collaboration
	Structured Teams:
		Better traditional with clearly defined roles and less frequent collabs
	Cross-Functional Teams:
		Agile, collaborative teams that engage frequently
6.\ Timeline Flexibility 
	Fixed Deadlines:
		Waterfall and traditional models
	Flexible Deadline:
		Agile allows for iterative delivery
7.\ Budget Constraints
	Strict Budget:
		Traditional models work better when budgets are fixed
	Adjustable Budget:
		Agile allows for Iterative Budgeting
8.\ Technical Expertise and Tools
	Low Tool Availability:
		Traditional maybe more feasible when tools are limited
	High Tool and Skill Availability:
		Agile requires specific tools and an experienced team in iterative development and collaboration
# Unit 2
### Scrum
Scrum Roles:
	Product Owner:
		Represents Stakeholders, responsible for maxing product value. Prioritizes product backlog to ensure dev team understands 
	Scrum Master:
		Facilitator, ensure teams follow Scrum practices
	Development Team:
		Self-organizing, cross-functional team working to deliver products during sprints. Decides how to complete work prioritized by product owner.
Artifacts:
	Product Backlog:
		Ranked Priority List. Product owner manages and adds new items as needed.
	Sprint Backlog:
		Selection of items from the product backlog chosen by the dev team to complete during sprint
	Increment:
		The usable and potentially releasable output of each sprint, which adds value to the product.
Scrum Events:
	Sprint:
		2-4 weeks (up to 30 days), team works and delivers an increment of product. New one starts immediately after one ends
	Sprint Planning:
		Held at beginning of each sprint, team decides what backlog of work to do.
	Daily Scrum:
		15 min meeting to discuss anything
	Sprint Review:
		Reviews sprint at the end of one, reflections and thoughts and discussions.
Scrum Principles:
	Transparency:
		Clear understanding of goals
	Inspection:
		Regular progress checks
	Adaptation:
		Adjust things based on inspections
Scrum Process:
	1. The Product Owner creates and manages the
	product backlog.
	2. During each sprint, the development team
	works on items from the sprint backlog.
	3. Daily Scrums ensure continuous alignment
	and progress.
	4. The sprint ends with a potentially releasable
	product increment, followed by a review and
	retrospective for improvement.
