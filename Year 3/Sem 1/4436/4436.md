Chapter 1:
	Host sends packets
		Recieves a application message and breaks into small data called packets, of length ***L*** bits
		Transmits at transmission rate ***R*** .aka bandwidth
	packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L/R

	Wireless Radio:
		signal carried in electromagnetc spectrum
		easily obstructed by environmental effects
	Radio Link Types:
		Terrestrial Microwave
			up to 45Mbps
		Wireless LAN(Wifi)
			Up to 100 Mbps
		Wide-area (cellular)
			4G cellular: 10Mbps
		Satellite
			45Mbps per channel
			270ms delay
			geosynchronous vs low-earth-orbit

	The Network Core
		mesh of interconnected routers
	Packet Switching
		hosts break application layer messages into packets
	Transmission delay
		L/R seconds to transmit L-bit packet to link at R bps
	Store and forward
		entire packet must arrive at router before transmitted to next link
	End-end delay
		L/R, assuming zero propagation delay
	Packet queuing and loss
		If arrival rate > transmission rate:
			packets will queue
			packets will drop if memory fills up
