### Measures of Location
**Mean**
	Population mean
		Uses population size of N

	Sample mean
		Uses sample size of n

**Median**
	Population median
		Uses population size of N

	Sample mean
		Uses sample size of n

**Mean vs Median**
Mean
	Takes the average of all data in the set, including outliers
	Is easier to work with statistically
Median
	Takes the average of the middle data set, excluding outliers
		For Odd data sets the median is the middle number
		For Even data sets the median is the sum of the two middle numbers / 2

**Quartiles**
Divide observed values into four pieces
	First quartile(Q1) is larger than one quarter of the values
	Second quartile(Q2) (median) is larger than half of the values
	Third quartile(Q3) is larger than three quarters of the values

**Percentiles**
	Percentiles divide the observed values into 100 equal pieces (100%)
**Fourths**
	Upper Fourth = median of the top half of the data
	Lower Fourth = median of the bottom half of the data
**Trimmed Mean**
	The 𝑐% trimmed mean is computed by averaging the middle 𝑐% of the observed values.
**Outliers/Extreme Values**
	The mean is based on all of the data but is very sensitive to outliers. 
	The median is based on only 1 or 2 points but is not sensitive to outliers.

### Measures of Variability
**Range**
	The difference between the largest and smallest values.
**Variance**
	Population variance
		Uses population of size N 
		![[Pasted image 20231101224521.png]]
		Sample deviation same thing but square root
	Sample variance
		Uses sample size n
		![[Pasted image 20231101224603.png]]
		Population standard deviation is the same thing but square root
**Fourth Spread**
	𝑓𝑠 = Upper Fourth − Lower Fourth
		Upper Fourth = median of the top half of the data 
		Lower Fourth = median of the bottom half of the data

**Five number summary**
	• Minimum
	• Lower fourth/first quartile
	• Median
	• Upper fourth/third quartile
	• Maximum
