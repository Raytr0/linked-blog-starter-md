### Notation
**Population and Sample Size**
	Commonly use N for population size, and n for size of sample.
**Variables**
	Commonly use lower case letters x,y,z
**Subscripts**
	Used to identify different realizations of the same quantity
	Use non numeric subscripts to identify generic realizations

### Stem-and-Leaf Displays
A stem-and-leaf display is created by dividing each observed value for a
variable into two parts:
- Stem: the leading digits
- Leaf: the trailing digits (usually rounded)

### Histograms
A histogram is constructed by:
1. Setting breakpoints.
2. Dividing the data into intervals using the breakpoints.
3. Plotting the frequency (count) or relative frequency (proportion) within each
interval.*

(Second graph is the best)
**Shape**
	Number of peaks 
		Unimodal = one peak 
		Bimodal = two peaks 
		Multimodal = more peaks
	Symmetry(Unimodal)
		Positively skewed = values tend to be farther from the mode on the right 
		Negative skewed = values tend to be farther from the mode on the left 
		Symmetric = the values on the right (approximately) mirror the values on the left

### Barplot
A barplot displays the distribution of a qualitative variable.
**How to construct a barplot**
	1. Counting the number of observations for each class.
	2. Plotting the frequency (count) or relative frequency (proportion) versus the
	class.
