### Samples Spaces and Events
**Sample Space** 
	The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes on experiment. 
	We denote the sample space mathematically with S.
**Event**
	An **event** is any subset (collection of outcomes) of the sample space.
	A **simple event** contains only one outcome. 
	A **compound event** contains multiple outcomes. 
	The **null event**, denoted âˆ…, contains no outcomes.
**Some Set Theory**
	Events are just sets (Apply Discrete Math logic)
