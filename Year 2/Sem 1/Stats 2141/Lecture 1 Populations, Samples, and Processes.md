### Data
**Population** 
	• The collection of objects (or people/animals/…) of interest.
**Census** 
	• A study in which information is obtained from the entire population.
**Sample** 
	• A subset of the population selected in some prescribed manner.
**Data** 
	• Observations for one or more variables from objects in a sample. 
**Variable** 
	• Any characteristic whose value may vary between objects. 
	• **Univariate** data contain values for only one variable. 
	• **Bivariate** data contain values for two variables. 
	• **Multivaraite** data contain values for more than two variables.

### Variable Types
**Quantitative**
	Measures the amount of something and can be ordered
		Continuous
			All possible values are in an entire interval on the number line
		Discrete
			Possible values are finite or can be listed in a infinite sequence
**Qualitative**
	Measures some characteristic and have no natural order

### Branches of Statistics
**Descriptive**
	Summarizes and describes the most important features of given data
**Inferential**
	Generalizes information in the data observed in a sample to draw conclusions about the population of interest
**Probability**
	The branch of mathematics that describes the characteristics of samples drawn from a population

### Collecting Data
**Simple Random Sample**
	All individuals in a population have the same chance of being included in the sample
**Stratifies Sample**
	The population is divided into groups and a simple random sample is drawn from each of the groups
**Convenience Sample**
	Units are drawn from the population based on convenience without systematic randomization
