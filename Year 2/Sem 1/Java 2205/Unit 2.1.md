### Data Structures
**Linear/Non-Linear**
	Linear:
		Data items are arranged in a sequential order
	Non-Linear:
		Data items are unordered
**Homogeneous or heterogeneous**
	Homogeneous:
		Same type data type
	Heterogeneous:
		Different type data type, Generic data types, ArrayList
### Data Insertion/Removal
**Arrays**
	Insertion requires us to create a copy and then add the new value in the new position, then copying the old array to the new array depending on the split of the array.
	Removal is similar as we need to copy the old array to a new one but with a reduced size, again depending on where the break is. (use System.arraycopy(oldArray, position, NewArray, Position, lengthOfNewArray))
### Stack
A collection of elements that follow the last-in, first-out principle
insertion is called push, deletion is called pop.
### Queue
A collection of elements that follow the first-in, first-out principle
A queue is open on both ends unlike stack
### Linked List
Objects are arranged in a linear order
There are generally two forms, Singly linked list and Doubly linked list
**Singly Linked List**
	Concrete data structure consisting a sequence of nodes
instances of each element that are linked
it can change order freely unlike arrays
