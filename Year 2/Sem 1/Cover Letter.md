Hello,

I am an second year Software Engineering student from Western University, my expected graduation year is 2026. I found out about the opportunity while searching for 4 month summer internship placements that would match my interests and future career. I enjoy working with computers and programming, so I think this position will really benefit me and assist me with choosing a future career related to this field.

So far I have taken multiple tech courses and various programming clubs throughout my time in high school and university, it really helped me in my understanding of computers and programming. I have also done co-op placements as a full stack web developer, and and have just finished working as an intern at Xinosys on a B2B web application with roles such as QA for Android devices, API development, and full stack web development.

My interest in programming and technology is what motivated me to apply to this position as I’m always looking to learn more. I believe that my team building skills will be a great support and help me on my journey to become a better programmer. I have previously been in the 540 Golden Hawks Royal Canadian Air Cadets for 5 years which has greatly improved my cooperative skills, and was also involved in the squadron’s marching band which has also further developed my teamwork skills.

Thank you for your time and consideration for going through my application. Please contact me if there are any questions regarding my experience or achievements, I would love to meet and talk about my experiences.

Sincerely, Ryan Huang.
