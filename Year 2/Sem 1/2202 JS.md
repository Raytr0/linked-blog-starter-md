Basic Data Types: Number, String, Boolean
null: object
undefined: undefined
JS is automatic type conversion
Boolean false: null, undefined, NaN, 0,  "" 
Arithmetic Operations: treat null as 0, undefined as NaN
Literal number strings such as "9" when using + a number, will result in a string ex "92"
When subtracting, it will be treated as a number "9"-2=7
If logical operators dont make sense, it will return the possible number given 
string and numbers under comparison operators will convert to numbers if it is literal number string "8"
note that === absolutely equal will not hold true as string != number

Bindings: let, var, const
Javascript is a weakly typed language
binding names cannot start with a digit and can include dollar sign and underscore

Function Declaration notation
```Js
function square(x){
	return x * x;
}
```
no return will return unidentified
function declarations are not part of the top to bottom flow control(you can have a function at the bottom and a function call at the top, function will automatically be read first)
```Js
const square = function(x){
	return x * x;
};
```
This is an anonymous function expression which can be treated like any other value
when assigned to a binding, the binding name can be used like a function name
Note: semicolon is needed at the end of function, line order is important
```Js
const square1 = (x) => {return x * x;};
const square2 = x => x*x;
```
Arrow functions
in single expression cases, you can omit the curly brackets and return

Optional Arguments
a function can only require one argument, but if you give more than one, the rest will be ignored

Functions as values
can be reassigned to different bindings(name change basically)
can be passed as parameters(treated like a value lmfao)

JS is an object based language
every value can be treated as an object
![[Pasted image 20231024195705.png]]
JS arrays a dynamic unlike java which are fixed sizes
Looping over array elements: normal form(like java), let "something" of "arrayname"(gives array values), let "something" in "arrayname"(gives array positions that have valid values, gives the POSITION)

Three dots operator
collects any number of arguements sent to a function in a array
in arrays, it will spread it out to the outer one(\[1,2,3,...\[4,5,6],7] will return \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])

String to array and array to string
something.split("what to look for to split")
something.join("what to put int the joined sections")

since every value is treated like an object, you can customize them
similar to bindings but no need to follow naming rules
![[Pasted image 20231024200411.png]]
can also be objects and arrays

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
all property names are surrounded by double quotes
only simple data expressions are allowed
![[Pasted image 20231024200614.png]]
JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()

"this" keyword just read end of 11

Lexical scoping
Global Scope: visible from anywhere
Local Scope: a function definition
Closure Scope: created by inner functions, allows the outer scope to be accessible from the inner function
Block Scope: created by let or const in loops, cant recognize var

Closures
combination of an inner function and its surrounding context


DOM
specifies how browsers create a page, and how javascript accesses an HTML page


```Javascript
/Normal function declaration
function square(x){
	return x*x;
}
console.log(square(5));
let squaring = function(x){
	return x*x;
}
console.log(squaring(5));
/Note: arrow functions do not have a "this." unlike other functions, cannot be used as constructors
let multiSelf = (x) => x*x;
console.log(multiSelf(5));
```

```javascript
//IIFE looks like this
(//outer round brackets
	//function declaration 
)("any arguements are passed here");
let x = 10;

(function()
	 {
		 console.log(x/2)
	 }
 )();
 (function(x)
	 {
		 console.log(x/2)
	 }
)(4);

(
x => {console.log(x/2)}
)(6);
```
