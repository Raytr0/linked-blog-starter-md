## Theorem 1.2
P is the statement d|m and d|n
q is d|(m+n)
If p is true then q is true

Assume p is true so d|m and d|n
therefore dk=m for some k (k is an integer)

dj=n for some int j
NEED SOME INTERGER l
such that dl = m+n
m+n = dk + dj = d(j+k)
so d|m+n

if {d|m, d|n then}p   {d|(m-n)}q   (p ->q)

proof:
d|m says dk = m
d|n says dj = n
for some k, j integers
So m-n = dk-dj = d(k-j)
So d|(m-n)


If d|m then d|mn

proof:
if d|m then dk=m for some integer k
NEED SOME j, AN INTEGER WITH 
dj=mn
dk = m
dkn =mn

## Theorem 1.3
n = 32, d=3
3 * q <= 32 (Find the biggest q)

3 * 10 = 30 <= 32
3 * 11 > 32
q = 10
r = 32 - 3 * 10 = 2
32/3 - remainder = 2

1) Find q such that qk<= n, q(k+1)>n
   Set r = n-dq
   Why is 0 <= r < d
   Suppose that r > d then r = d+t for some integer
   n-dq = r = d+t
   n = d(q+1)+t and d(q+1)>n cannot be true at the same time
   conclude 0 <= r < d
