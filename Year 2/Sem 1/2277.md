I have been using discord since 2017 and have thoroughly enjoyed my time using it with friends, while being a user is great, becoming a part of the team that develops one of my favorite applications would be an amazing experience! I have also tinkered with discord bots and I do have a side project of creating one that I have unfortunately put on hold, but I would sometime in the future like to finish it!
